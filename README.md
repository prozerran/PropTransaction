# Crypto Sentiment Indicator Mini Project

This project determines the overall crypto sentiment.
It compares the US market to Asian markets for sentiment.

It can potentially be used for arbitration between exchanges since either markets are net buyers or net sellers,
thus, you can profit from the spread and differences in price.

Overall, it determines the sentiment between the two continents, based on the Korean kimchi premium indicator.
If the kimchi premium is high, then there is possible euphoria in the Asian markets, where as if there is a discount,
then it could be a good buying opportunity.
